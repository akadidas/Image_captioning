# Image_captioning

# Project Overview
In this project, you will create a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.

After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext [I'm an inline-style link with title](http://cocodataset.org/#home "MS COCO") dataset to train your network, you will test your network on novel images!

# Project Instructions
The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order:

0_Dataset.ipynb
1_Preliminaries.ipynb
2_Training.ipynb
3_Inference.ipynb
